# PrimeNumberCalculator
Program to check whether a number is prime, and further whether it can be written in the form x^2 + 1
Created by: Chikezie Wood, Nov. 14, 2022.

This program has two main parts - it will identify whether the user inputted number is prime
If prime, then it will check if the number can be written in the form x^2 + 1

It will take input from the user in the form of an integer - will throw an exception if a non-interger value is entered 
(deliberately did not spend time to handle these given it was for a small assignment)
Program will continue to prompt for additional prime numbers. To exit, enter 0 (which is neither prime nor composite)
